The Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) certification exam assesses a student's ability to perform a network penetration test at a professional level. The student must perform Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to gather intel on how to properly attack the network. Once inside, the student must leverage their Active Directory exploitation skillsets to compromise the exam domain controller. After a successful compromise, the student must provide a detailed written report and perform a live debrief in front of our assessors to receive a passing score and certification.
