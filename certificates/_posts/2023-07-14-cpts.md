HTB CPTS holders will possess technical competency in the ethical hacking and penetration testing domains at an intermediate level. They will be able to spot security issues and identify avenues of exploitation that may not be immediately apparent from searching for CVEs or known exploit PoCs. They can also think outside the box, chain multiple vulnerabilities to showcase maximum impact, and actionably help organizations remediate vulnerabilities through commercial-grade pentesting reports.
