# Introduction to Cybersecurity

* toc
{:toc}

## Terms and definitions 
Cybersecurity (or security): The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation

**Cloud security**: The process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured and access to those assets is limited to authorized users

**Internal threat:** A current or former employee, external vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk

**Network security:** The practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access

**Personally identifiable information (PII):** Any information used to infer an individual’s identity

**Security posture:** An organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change 

**Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII):** A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines

**Technical skills:** Skills that require knowledge of specific tools, procedures, and policies 

**Threat:** Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets

**Threat actor:** Any person or group who presents a security risk

**Transferable skills:** Skills from other areas that can apply to different careers 


## Phishing
Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

* **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.

* **Spear phishing:** A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

* **Whaling:** A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.

* **Vishing:** The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

* **Smishing:** The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

## Malware
Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.  

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

* **Viruses:** Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.

* **Worms:** Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.

* **Ransomware:** A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 

* **Spyware:** Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

## Social Engineering 
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

* **Social media phishing:** A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

* **Watering hole attack:** A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

* **USB baiting:** A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 

* **Physical social engineering:** A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

## Social engineering principles 
Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

* **Authority:** Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 

* **Intimidation:** Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 

* **Consensus/Social proof:** Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 

* **Scarcity:** A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 

* **Familiarity:** Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  

* **Trust:** Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.

* **Urgency:** A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.


## CISSP Domain

The CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) certification covers eight domains, each representing a fundamental aspect of information security. Here's a brief explanation of each:

**Security and Risk Management:** This domain covers the foundational concepts of information security, including risk management, governance, compliance, and ethical considerations. It addresses the establishment and maintenance of a security program.

**Asset Security:** Focuses on protecting organizational assets, including data and hardware. It covers the classification, handling, retention, and disposal of information.

**Security Architecture and Engineering:** Covers the design and implementation of secure architectures, including hardware, software, and network security. It includes concepts such as cryptography, security models, and secure systems design.

**Communication and Network Security:** Addresses the protection of data in transit and the design and implementation of secure communication channels and network infrastructures. It includes topics like network protocols, security controls, and secure communication techniques.

**Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Focuses on ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to resources. It includes identity management, authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms.

**Security Assessment and Testing:** Covers the evaluation of security systems to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with policies and regulations. It includes topics such as penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and security audits.

**Security Operations:** Deals with the day-to-day operations of maintaining security, including incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity. It also covers monitoring, logging, and the management of physical and environmental security.

**Software Development Security:** Focuses on integrating security into the software development lifecycle. It includes secure coding practices, application security, and the assessment of software vulnerabilities.


## Frameworks

**The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)**
FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. These types of organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. They are also legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC. 

**The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®)**
FedRAMP is a U.S. federal government program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings. Its purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third-party cloud providers. 

**Center for Internet Security (CIS®)**
CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. Its purpose is to help organizations establish a better plan of defense. CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs. 

**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.

**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**
PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud. 

**The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**
HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent.

**International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**
ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste, and services. 

**System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)**
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) auditing standards board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels
