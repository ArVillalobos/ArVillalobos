# Network Analysis – Web Shell

* toc
{:toc}

## Scenario

Scenario
The SOC received an alert in their SIEM for ‘Local to Local Port Scanning’ where an internal private IP began scanning another internal system. Can you investigate and determine if this activity is malicious or not? You have been provided a PCAP, investigate using any tools you wish.

We proceed to use wireshark, this tool is a network traffic analyser that can support pcap files.

Watching into all the packages we see a lot of failed handshakes marked in red. Usually this happens when someone is doing a port scan. Like `nmap`, it does just part of SYN, thats why in wireshark screenshot i saw many `RST,ACK (Reset, Access Check)` flags when a port is closed. We can see the difference between an open and closed port.

Knowing this we can proceed to the challenge.

### What is the IP responsible for conducting the port scan activity? (1 points)
**10.251.96.4**

![image5](/assets/img/machines/blueteam/naws/naws5.png){:.lead width="800" height="100" loading="lazy"}

What is the port range scanned by the suspicious host? (1 points)
**1-1024**

For this one i created a new columns and assign `Destination Port` and the, i sorted it and found de max port.

![image6](/assets/img/machines/blueteam/naws/naws6.png){:.lead width="800" height="100" loading="lazy"}

What is the type of port scan conducted? (1 points)
**TCP SYN**

Two more tools were used to perform reconnaissance against open ports, what were they? (1 points)
**gobuster 3.0.1, sqlmap 1.4.7**

We make a filter for open ports, the way to identify them is to see that the handshake established a `SYN,ACK`

```txt
tcp.dstport == 41675
```

![image7](/assets/img/machines/blueteam/naws/naws7.png){:.lead width="800" height="100" loading="lazy"}

Then i filtered for http requests to find user agent header.

```txt
tcp.dstport == 80 && ip.src == 10.251.96.4 && http
```

![image9](/assets/img/machines/blueteam/naws/naws9.png){:.lead width="800" height="100" loading="lazy"}


What is the name of the php file through which the attacker uploaded a web shell? (1 points)
**editprofile.php**

![image10](/assets/img/machines/blueteam/naws/naws10.png){:.lead width="800" height="100" loading="lazy"}


What is the name of the web shell that the attacker uploaded? (1 points)
**dbfunctions.php**

What is the parameter used in the web shell for executing commands? (1 points)
**cmd**

What is the first command executed by the attacker? (1 points)
**cmd**


This third questions can be answered in one image, in this one i found a dbfunctions.php file that accepts `cmd` parameter, this is certainly a IOC (Indicator Of Compromise), that is executing an `id` command.

![image11](/assets/img/machines/blueteam/naws/naws11.png){:.lead width="800" height="100" loading="lazy"}


What is the type of shell connection the attacker obtains through command execution? (1 points)
**reverse shell**

What is the port he uses for the shell connection? (1 points)
**4422**

In this image we can see that is making a reverse shell with python at port 4422
